Bug reports, new feature request are appreciated.

Pull requests to fix bugs, add new features, fix awful code, and making this documents neat and pretty (because I am not good at this) are also very welcome.

Also, as English is not my first language, there should be some wrong grammers and stuff.

If you would like, please try to fix those.

Please feel free to reach out to me on Discord (eve0415#0415) if you're interested in helping out with Minecraft-API.
