Bug reports, new feature request are appreciated.

Pull requests to fix bugs, add new features, fix awful code, and making this documents neat and pretty (because I am not good at these things) are also very welcome.

Please feel free to reach out to me on Discord (eve0415#0415) if you're interested in helping out with Minecraft-API.
