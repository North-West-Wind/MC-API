Before using this library, you need to extract the required classes.

```js
const { curseforge, mojang, paper } = require('aio-mc-api');
```

:::note
Most methods are asynchronous as the library sends http requests to server and fetching the responses.
:::

The guides are created for each API. Use the sidebar to navigate what you want to see.
